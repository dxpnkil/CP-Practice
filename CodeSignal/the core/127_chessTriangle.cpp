  Consider a bishop, a knight and a rook on an n Ã— m chessboard. 
  They are said to form a triangle if each piece attacks exactly one other piece and is attacked by exactly one piece. 
  Calculate the number of ways to choose positions of the pieces to form a triangle.
  
  input:  n = 2 and m = 3
  ouput:  solution(n, m) = 8

# 2x3 there are 2 configurations possible, with reflections and rotations multiplying that by 4
# 2x4 there are an additional 2 configurations possible, with reflections and rotations multiplying that by 4
# 3x3 there are an additional 2 configurations possible up to rotations and reflection
# 3x4 there are an additional 2 configurations possible up to rotation and reflection
